Byte SWEET16 article Qs:
[ ] "store pop" instr ?
[ ] CPR example vs BP example (see also, BS example, for ref)

SWEET16 exercises:
* re-write
    * clear screen
    * ascii table
    * draw square
    * hgr programs as well, if that seems useful

---

Program ideas:

[x] clear screen
[x] ascii table
[x] hello world
[x] echo reverse

[>] bell

[x] PRHEX
[x] PRBYTE
[x] PRNTAX

[x] paint screen solid colors (HGR)
[x] 8x8 checker board pattern (HGR)
[x] chess pieces; pixel art by Sammy

[x] draw rc logo (HGR)
[x] tile the screen with it
[x] play with artifact colors, and flag bits
[ ] colors

Demo ideas:
* We could use the 4-colors painting trick in the scene transitions
(And Maybe there’s an analogous trick for dhgr ?)
NOTE: we should be able to interleave pairing one screen with buffering the next one, for instant switching afterwords (and a juicier painting anim.) win-win!

* DHGR

future project ideas:
* bell
- life, with blocks (could do this in low-res, and see how fast … but maybe there’s other stuff I wanna do)
- Life w blocks in hi res
- Life w dots (how fast can you make it ??) could be some cool bit twiddling thing, idk
- Life w RC logo
* something with always-listening audio xfer
